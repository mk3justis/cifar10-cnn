# cifar10-cnn
This was an assignment for Algorithms in Machine Learning where I loaded the CIFAR10 dataset and made a train set and a test set.
I then created a CNN model and trained it on the training set. I kept track of the average validation loss and accuracy, and plotted it on a chart.

This was all done using torch, torchvision, and matplotlib.
